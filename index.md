### A bi-weekly review club for LND PRs

<span class="question">What is this?</span> &nbsp;A club for reviewing
LND PRs **every second Thursday of the month at 17:00 UTC** in the
#review-club channel on
[LND Developer Community Slack](https://lightning.engineering/slack.html).

<span class="question">What's it for?</span> &nbsp;To help newer contributors
learn about the LND review process. The review club is *not* primarily
intended to help open PRs get merged (although that might be a nice
side-effect).

<span class="question">Who should take part?</span> &nbsp;Anyone who wants to
learn about contributing to LND. All are welcome to come and ask
questions!

<span class="question">What's the benefit for participants?</span>
&nbsp;Reviewing and testing PRs is the best way to start contributing to LND,
but it's difficult to know where to start. There are hundreds of open PRs,
many require a lot of contextual knowledge, and contributors and reviewers often
use unfamiliar terminology. The review club will give you the tools and
knowledge you need in order to take part in the [LND review
process](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/code_contribution_guidelines.md#code-review)
on GitHub.

<span class="question">How do I take part?</span> Just show up on [Slack](https://lightning.engineering/slack.html)! See
[Attending your first PR Review Club](/your-first-meeting) 
for more tips on how to participate.

<span class="question">Who runs this?</span> &nbsp;Lightning Labs evangelist
[lucasdcf](https://github.com/lucasdcf) started the review club and schedules
the upcoming meetings. Individual meetings are hosted by a variety of LND
contributors. See some of our [previous hosts](/meetings-hosts/).
