## Notes

* In this PR we extend the implementation of the graph based `EstimateRouteFee`` RPC with a payment probe based approach to obtain a more reliable routing fee estimate.

## Questions

- Why would sending a payment probe improve the fee estimate for `EstimateRouteFee`?
- What's the difference in behavior between calling with an invoice or a destination pubkey? 
- What is the purpose of the random payment hash in `probePaymentRequest`?
- What is the expected payment response if a probe is successful?
- What information have you learned about the network if a single htlc was used in SendPaymentV2?
- And what information have you learned if multiple htlcs were involved?
- How could you theoretically send a probe that is more reliable?
- What defines an 'LSP' in the code? 
- Why is there an exception in the code for nodes connected only to an LSP?
- What is the main difference in the way the fee is estimated for an LSP attached node?
- How does the adjustment of route hints for LSPs work?
- Why is there a test that probes to a destination without channels?
