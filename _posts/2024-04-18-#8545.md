## General questions about Lightning Channel Openings in LND:

- What are the different ways of funding a lightning channel in LND (creating the funding transaction)? Think of possible use-cases for the different methods (e.g. the internal LND wallet).
- What does the batch channel opening cmd use to open channels, does it use the internal wallet?
- What would be needed to implement BatchChannelClosings, are they even possible today without protocol changes?
- Explain the concept of a “zero-conf" channel and outline what a good use-case might be.

## PR Related Questions

- What’s the underlying problem this PR is trying to solve.
- Can a transaction not signalling RBF (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki rule 1) be RBFed, if so how?
- What is the subsystem which tends to RBF outputs. When would this subsystem try to RBF an output (walk through a likely example).
- What happens to a zero-conf channel which inputs are RBFed (before the channel funding transaction is confirmed)
- Is it currently possible to close such a channel (coop-close or force-close)?
- Does this PR solve the RBF issue completely for channel-openings or are further improvements planed.
