## Notes

- Reviewing [PR #7175](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/7175) is not mandatory, but will provide more context.
- Requires a high-level understanding of how a payment makes use of HTLCs.

## Questions

* - Did you review the PR? If yes, whatâ€™s your overall verdict? (ACK, NACK, concept ACK, unknown)
- When is a payment marked as completed:
        - from the sender's PoV?
        - from the receiver's PoV?
- Is the interface of `MPPayment` user-friendly & sufficient? What is its responsibility?
- What's the significance of `NeedWaitAttempts`? Why do we need to very carefully control the HTLCs that relate to a payment?
- When all payment shards (that cover the full amount) are released what is LND waiting for?
- If the receiver reveals the preimage prematurely (before they receive all the HTLCs) what should LND do? Does AMP eliminate this issue?
- What's the importance of refactoring the payment lifecycle? Can a node lose funds if they erroneously track a payment's lifecycle?
