title: "funding: add fundmax flag to OpenChannelRequest"

## Notes

* The majority of the code change is in the `lnwallet/chanfunding` package. The flow for opening channels at the code-level is, roughly, `rpcserver.go` -> `funding/manager.go` -> `lnwallet`. User-specified parameters such as fundmax will reach the `lnwallet` code through this path.
* Check out the channel funding coin selection logic in `lnwallet/chanfunding/coin_select.go`
* Consider checking out `itest/lnd_channel_funding_fund_max_test.go` to have a good overview of fundmax behavior.
